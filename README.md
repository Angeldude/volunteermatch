# The VolunteerMatch Public-Use API Gem

VolunteerMatch is a lightweight Ruby wrapper that queries VolunteerMatch's Public-Use API for searching information on nonprofit organizations and active volunteering opportunities. 

This gem is inspired by the Ruby api example provided in [vm-contrib repo](https://github.com/volunteermatch/vm-contrib){:target="_blank"}. Queries are configured based on the attributes applied and return a collection of JSON results. 

The Official documentation on using the API can be found at [VolunteerMatch.org](http://cdn.volunteermatch.org/www/legal/VM-Public-use-API-user-manual.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
